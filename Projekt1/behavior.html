        <h2>Understanding Monkey Behavior</h2>
        <p>Monkeys exhibit a range of behaviors that reflect their intelligence and social complexity. From grooming rituals to vocal calls, their actions reveal much about their interactions, hierarchies, and survival strategies.</p>
        
        <section>
            <h3>Social Structure and Hierarchy</h3>
            <p>Monkeys live in groups, or troops, with established social hierarchies. These hierarchies often influence access to food, mating partners, and shelter.</p>
            <p>For example, in a troop of macaques, the dominant individuals often lead the group, deciding where to find food and setting boundaries against other groups. This social structure helps maintain order and improve the groupâ€™s overall survival.</p>

            <h3>Grooming as Social Bonding</h3>
            <p>Grooming is a common behavior among monkeys, serving not only as a means of cleaning but also as a way to establish and strengthen social bonds. By grooming one another, monkeys reinforce trust and reduce stress within the group.</p>
            <p>In some species, lower-ranking individuals groom those higher in rank as a sign of respect, further solidifying social structures and roles within the group.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Communication and Vocalizations</h3>
            <p>Monkeys use a variety of vocalizations, gestures, and facial expressions to communicate. These sounds and signals can indicate danger, express emotions, or coordinate group movements.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Warning Calls:</strong> Many monkeys have specific calls to warn the troop of predators, allowing them to take cover or flee.</li>
                <li><strong>Affectionate Sounds:</strong> Some monkeys make soft cooing noises to soothe their young or express affection toward one another.</li>
                <li><strong>Territorial Calls:</strong> Monkeys like howlers use loud calls to mark territory, signaling to other groups to keep their distance.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h3>Tool Use and Intelligence</h3>
            <p>Some monkey species are capable of using tools to obtain food, showcasing their problem-solving abilities. Capuchin monkeys, for instance, have been observed using stones to crack nuts or sticks to retrieve insects from crevices.</p>
            <p>This tool use not only highlights their intelligence but also illustrates how monkeys adapt their behavior to meet their needs in various environments.</p>

        <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
        <p>Monkeys are one of the few animals that can recognize themselves in a mirror, a sign of self-awareness. Not all species pass this test, but some, like capuchins, have shown curiosity about their reflections!</p>
        <p>Monkeys have different calls and gestures for communicating danger, food, or affection, making their social interactions complex and fascinating.</p>
        <p>Some monkey species are omnivores, meaning they eat both plants and small animals like insects, making them adaptable to various environments.</p>
